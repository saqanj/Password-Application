# Password-Application
My own custom password generator algorithm developed on Java. To couple with it, is a custom classification model that determines the strength of a password, and a push-to-excel feature that categorizes all passwords and associated websites in an Excel spreadsheet. Inspired by Apple's new "Use a Strong Password" feature.
