# Password-Application
- PASSWORD ALGORITHM EXPLANATION: There are three types of data when generating a password. Letters, numbers, and special characters. The user must provide the amount from each category they would like to include in their password, without repititions (i.e., the user can only ask for 10 numbers maximum because a keyboard only has numbers 0-9 without integer repitions). Then, the algorithm assigns each possible character from each of the three categories a random and fair probability value between 0 and 1, exclusive. Then, based on how many characters from each category the user desires, denoted as N, the algorithm picks the characters with the highest N probabilities to include in the final password using a customized implementation of quick-sort. Then, once the password is put together, it undergoes the Fisher-Yates Shuffling algorithm due to its superior asymptotic efficiency. Finally then, the password is outputted to the user.
